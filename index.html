                    <p class="text-white">I'm a student at Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology, on track to
                        graduate in April 2024. My college ride has been quite the adventure, exploring a mix of
                        subjects—from web design and photography to videography and UX design. But you know what really
                        caught my eye? Motion graphics! During a group project in the video production course, I took
                        charge of creating most of the motion graphics used. That experience got me hyped up for an
                        upcoming dedicated course in that field. Exploring motion graphics got me hooked because it's
                        just so fascinating and has a combination of creativity and logic!</p>

                    <p class="text-white">I'm all about soaking up new knowledge—I dive into tutorials across a wide
                        range of topics. My only setback is sometimes not fully mastering a specific subject. That's
                        also where my strength lies—I've got a solid grasp of many topics and an insatiable appetite to
                        learn more. This inherent curiosity keeps me driven to expand my skill set and venture into
                        uncharted territories. Here's to embracing the joy of learning across the board!

                            communications class. The task was to make a brochure for an imaginary product with the
                            focus being on concise and precise copy. I then took that concept and used it to create the
                            company and additional products for a Shopify assignment.

                            <p>The third semester I worked on a group project that was documentary style video. We chose
                                to do it
                                on
                                a brewpub and its owner in the Ottawa area called Tooth and Nail. The story is of Matt
                                Tweedy and
                                his
                                discovery of wanting to start the business and some insight into the brewing process he
                                is
                                passionate
                                about.
                            <p>We had six weeks to complete the project among our other classes and their
                                projects. We made
                                it
                                to all weekly meetings with the professor and had all the documentation ready for
                                presentation. At
                                times we were even ahead of schedule. One example is I had some samples of the type of
                                motion
                                graphics
                                and infographic ready to show the professor. </p>
                            <p>He was so encouraged by our work in
                                progress that he
                                slotted us for the first to present to the two Video Production classes combined
                                presentation that
                                one
                                of the program coordinators came to watch some of them. I am very proud of what we
                                produced
                                together.

                            <p>My roles in the production of the video span the whole process from the brainstorming to
                                the final
                                edit. The on-set roles I performed were setting up and monitoring the main camera used
                                in the
                                interview and to help set up the lighting. I also helped capture some of the first set
                                of b-roll.</p>
                            <p>Two
                                highlights I have from this part are nailing the creative treatment with the shallow
                                depth of field
                                and catching the LED panel reflecting in the glasses of our stand-in. </p>
                            <p>The creative
                                treatment we were
                                aiming for was a soft background while still having it present in the shot. We also
                                wanted it to
                                have
                                a warm and casual conversational feel with the subjects being interviewed. </p>
                            <p>The subject of our interview also wears glasses. The way I worked around this is placing
                                a reflector at the foot of the light and turning the panel to aim directly at it. This
                                aided the key light which we had set at a higher angle by filling the face from the
                                bottom and front, softening up the shadows. Making sure these were taken care of
                                in-camera made post production that much easier.</p>

                    <h5>Motion Graphics</h5>
                    <p>My major role was creating the motion graphics and animations which wasn’t initially slated for
                        me to do. I created our group’s logo and made the animation for it. The original design was made
                        using vector illustrations that translated into After Effects easily. I kept the animation
                        simple and to the point but feel like it is impactful.</p>
                    <p>One of the first motion graphics I had in mind when brainstorming was to take the existing logos
                        the brewery had already on their cans. The art style used was a vintage, hand-drawn look to
                        them. To highlight the style, I created what looked like paper cutouts of the different layers I
                        felt were there.</p>
                    <p>I used Illustrator to do this, since at this point, I didn’t know that you could import Photoshop
                        documents and the layers would be treated the same way. Outside of the little bit we had done in
                        class, this was the first animation that I made in After Effects. I created a few of these, one
                        of which I also took initiative to learn Duik Angela to make. One of the animations was used by
                        a group member to create the lower thirds.</p>
                    <p>I followed some tutorials to create the map animation and for the inspiration of the timeline
                        infographic.I cut the audio from the interview to make it concise and edited it. I synced the
                        animation timing to the key moments in the audio clip. The images echo that of the branding
                        already established by the brand. To further bring in the branding, I used a bright red for the
                        pins and the markers on the map, as well as the bold red line of the timeline that looks like
                        the ones on the top of the can.</P>
                    <p>Finally, I did the credits. I modified a template to feel like the bubbles and foam of a golden
                        beer. As
                        a
                        team we didn’t see obvious places that my logo animations could work but wanted to make sure
                        they were
                        used. At the time of the decision, I only had three created and needed a total of five to match
                        the
                        number
                        of us that were on the team. Since we each played a part in so many roles, we opted to not have
                        titles.
                        I
                        felt that it was important to include thanks to the establishment, the creator of the logos, the
                        school,
                        and the Algonquin peoples on top of those we had interviewed. Unfortunately, our main subject’s
                        father
                        had
                        passed away during the postproduction of this piece. We included a tribute to him before the
                        credits
                        roll
                        since he was an important figure in our subject’s life.

                    <h5>Editing</h5>
                    <p>I had the role of final editing. The main tasks I had were color grading the second camera that
                        we used
                        and to keyframe all of the cuts made in the audio. Due to the differences in cameras, there was
                        a
                        dramatic
                        difference in the white balance between the two. Since the video was already cut and sequenced,
                        I used
                        an
                        adjustment layer to quickly apply the same settings over all of the clips. I then went back and
                        tweaked
                        the ones that were a little further off. Unfortunately, the room tone we initially took was no
                        longer
                        with
                        the project. The main way I got around this was by finding a pause between a question being
                        asked and
                        the
                        answer that followed. It wasn’t the ideal situation, but at least there was room tone under all
                        of the
                        cuts and the keyframes done. Finally, I added the music. I identified the key moments and made
                        sure to
                        place the more emotional break in the music on those parts and blended the ends of the music
                        with the
                        next. We limited our video to have two tracks, one was used for the interview and the second was
                        used
                        for
                        the animations and the credits. We wanted to make sure there was a energizing rock tune but
                        still
                        cinematic to carry along the narrative,</p>

                    <h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p>There were some challenges with this project that made for good learning experiences. When
                        working on a
                        large project, I like to work as if the timeline is about a quarter less than what is given.
                        I’ve
                        experienced unexpected setbacks or interruptions, and by working with the decrease in allotted
                        time
                        allowed me to stay on track when that happens. If there is no disruption, it allows for more
                        polishing
                        time. Unfortunately, when working in a group not everyone shares this method, and it can be
                        quite
                        stressful. One way I managed this was my self-guided learning on After Effects even though I
                        didn’t have
                        the footage at the time. I built a template that the timing could be modified based on the audio
                        we got.
                        I
                        also worked on other projects that had a similar deadline. The other challenge was limiting the
                        working
                        hours on this project. It became a passion project as well as wanting to make something that
                        would pass
                        the assignment. The number of hours spent on this is outside the realm of what the original
                        scope of the
                        promo video offered to the subject in the video.</p>

                    <p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience and has led me to learning a lot more about
                        After
                        Effects and motion graphics. </p>

                        <p>During Symbols, Texts and Their Meanings course there were many topics and I was assigned a
                            visual demonstration of my understanding. I was enjoying learning After Effects and wanted
                            to practice further and apply it to this assignment. It features keying overlays, creating a
                            parallax effect on a static image, animating the blink effect and video editing.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-2">Target Audience</h5>
                        <p>Young Adults to Seniors with a Western/North American Cultural Perspective. </p>
                        <p>Young adults to Seniors that have a western/north american type of understanding of the
                            symbols and icons of the life stages. I didn’t include any people in traditional dress of
                            other countries/traditions. A specific example is the right of passage of learning to drive
                            in the mid teenage years. Many other cultures, the education stops at primary school due to
                            many reasons like working in the family business or the inability to pay for it. The same
                            reason that college isn’t a natural stepping stone in growing up.</p>
                        <h5 class="mt-2">Words/Symbols/signs</h5>
                        <p>
                            Empty bed in juxtaposition to the series of elderly photographs makes the connection that
                            they have passed away without having to say so. The phrase “in loving memory” is also a
                            symbol for the death of a loved one. The phrase invokes that feeling of loss. Another
                            index/symbol that I used is the fact that each stage of life the images are one quarter of a
                            second shorter after each blink transition. It represents the feeling that as you grow older
                            the passing of time seems to go faster and faster. Then when the concept of loss happens,
                            the clips are then extended to the length that the infant clips are set to. It gives the
                            audience a chance to reflect and feel loss and give them a chance to process what they saw
                            and connect to the concept of time as well as loss.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="mt-2">Fonts</h5>
                        <p>
                            The main font that I picked is Palatino Linotype and I chose it because it is clean, easy to
                            read with the limited time for the blink transition. It also gives me the feeling of classic
                            and timelessness.I also used Poked because it is similar to a kid's handwriting. It is used
                            to remind the viewer of writing in school and that feeling of a crayon in their hand. Poked
                            evolves into Indie Flower. A more mature version of handwriting. Then Source Code Pro is
                            used to symbolize the way technology/computers become a centralized factor of this stage of
                            life. The feeling that Freestyle Script gives helps bring emphasis by imitating the
                            handwriting that a relative would use on a paper check.

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Summary:</h5>
                    <p>This brand and line of products are the result of two different assignments. The focus on
                        one assignment
                        was precise and concise writing featuring products or services that didn't exist. I used my
                        skills in
                        Photoshop and Illustrator to stylize the brochure for a novel cosmetic company. I used this
                        project as
                        inspiration for my Shopify assignment that I had in Content Management Systems. I made two
                        additional
                        products, a lip gloss and a toothpaste. I wanted to have an elegant but a dark look. I took
                        inspiration
                        for the logo and color pallet from old wine, perfume and potion labels. The content is
                        inspired
                        by
                        historical horror movies. Filled with puns, the text adds a fun and humorous side without
                        taking
                        away
                        from
                        the sleek look of the document. </p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Logo and Design</h5>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12 col-xl-4 text-center"><img
                                src="./assets/images/photos/mywork/moon-scream-logo-274x350.jpg" alt="Moon Scream Logo"
                                class="my-2">
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-12 col-xl-8">
                            <p>The project started with the idea of moonscreen, which would be applied like
                                sunscreen.
                                The
                                concepts
                                that
                                helped shape the logo design are the words “luxury” and “premium”. I used rich
                                colors
                                like red,
                                black
                                and
                                gold to sell the idea that this was a product that those of high class would use.
                                Black
                                is a color
                                that
                                is
                                often associated with night and I used it as the foundation to apply the other
                                elements.
                                The deep
                                red
                                compliments the darkness that comes from the black. The gold adds a contrasting
                                highlight as well as
                                to
                                communicate the idea of it being that luxury item. The shape with the die cut
                                corners
                                was directly
                                inspired by the labels. It also gives the logo a bold shape that is neither feminine
                                or
                                masculine.
                                The
                                bats were initially hand drawn and were created to push the narrative of the
                                “creature
                                of the night”
                                and
                                add an element of elegance with the fine detail. The drawings were then translated
                                into
                                vectors to
                                make
                                sure that all of the symmetry lined up. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Copy</h5>
                    <p>To create the copy for the brochure, I drew inspiration from a cast of classic horror story
                        and
                        film
                        characters, infusing the text with a blend of puns and satire. The catalyst for this
                        creative
                        process
                        was
                        the enigmatic aristocrat Dorian Gray, as imagined by both Oscar Wilde and Alan Moore. Mr.
                        Gray's
                        review,
                        'I can't see myself without it,' sets the tone for the brochure's whimsical yet eerie
                        atmosphere. In
                        both
                        Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' and Moore's portrayal, Dorian hides away his portrait,
                        a
                        private
                        reflection of his moral degradation, concealed from prying eyes within his home.</p>
                    <p>Then there are the doctor recommendations. Dr. Victor Frankenstein is my favorite of the
                        recommendations.
                        He goes to say “Each ingredient has been patiently and expertly collected and combined in a
                        way
                        that brings new life to the beauty and skin care industry.” This highlights the base of the
                        story of
                        Frankenstein by Mary Shelly in which Dr. Frankenstein creates a new life from collected body
                        parts. I
                        had
                        a lot of fun trying to find all of the ways I could play with words.</p>
                    <h5>Products</h5>
                    <p>The initial product is the moonscreen called Moon Scream and the two products that were
                        created
                        for my
                        Shopify assignment are a line of lip glosses based on poisonous flowers, Good Night Kiss,
                        and
                        fang
                        paste,
                        Pearly Bites. I continued to use the same base logo shape as the Moon Scream but on the
                        corners
                        the
                        images
                        were changed to relate to the new products. The colors that were used are black and gold
                        with
                        the main
                        color related to the variation on the product.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Bonus</h5>
                    <p>It hasn’t been put up for sale yet, but I did make a repeating pattern to use for fabrics and
                        wallpaper
                        using the bats. I used Adobe Illustrator to create a seamless pattern in two different size
                        variations.
                        I
                        intend on getting some fabric printed to make a dress out of and I know someone who wants to
                        order it as
                        wallpaper for her dining room.</p>

                    <p>I love to explore photoshop so I expanded on the assignment here. The parameters was to cut
                        out
                        two
                        subjects and place them on a different background. The movie Rocky Horror Picture Show was
                        my
                        inspiration. I found a font that is very similar to the movie title and captured images of
                        two
                        of the
                        characters. I used colors present in the film as well.</p>

                    <p>I used many tools to create the background and the golden seal. All of the text are modified
                        quotes
                        or a play-on-words from the film.</p>
