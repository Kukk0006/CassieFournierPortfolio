                    <p class="text-white">I'm a student at Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology, on track to
                        graduate in April 2024. My college ride has been quite the adventure, exploring a mix of
                        subjects—from web design and photography to videography and UX design. But you know what really
                        caught my eye? Motion graphics! During a group project in the video production course, I took
                        charge of creating most of the motion graphics used. That experience got me hyped up for an
                        upcoming dedicated course in that field. Exploring motion graphics got me hooked because it's
                        just so fascinating and has a combination of creativity and logic!</p>

                    <p class="text-white">I'm all about soaking up new knowledge—I dive into tutorials across a wide
                        range of topics. My only setback is sometimes not fully mastering a specific subject. That's
                        also where my strength lies—I've got a solid grasp of many topics and an insatiable appetite to
                        learn more. This inherent curiosity keeps me driven to expand my skill set and venture into
                        uncharted territories. Here's to embracing the joy of learning across the board!

                            communications class. The task was to make a brochure for an imaginary product with the
                            focus being on concise and precise copy. I then took that concept and used it to create the
                            company and additional products for a Shopify assignment.

                            <p>The third semester I worked on a group project that was documentary style video. We chose
                                to do it
                                on
                                a brewpub and its owner in the Ottawa area called Tooth and Nail. The story is of Matt
                                Tweedy and
                                his
                                discovery of wanting to start the business and some insight into the brewing process he
                                is
                                passionate
                                about.
                            <p>We had six weeks to complete the project among our other classes and their
                                projects. We made
                                it
                                to all weekly meetings with the professor and had all the documentation ready for
                                presentation. At
                                times we were even ahead of schedule. Such as when is I had some samples of the type of

                            <p>He was so excited by our work in
                                progress that he
                                slotted us for the first to present. He combined the two Video Production classes to
                                present together. One
                                of the program coordinators came to watch the first four. I am very proud of what we
                                produced
                                together.

                                                to

                                                interview and to help set up the lighting. I also helped capture some of
                                                the first
                                                set

                                                highlights I have from this part are nailing the creative treatment with
                                                the shallow
                                                depth of field
                                                and catching the LED panel reflecting in the glasses of our stand-in.

                                            <p>The creative
                                                treatment we were
                                                aiming for was a soft background while still having it present in the
                                                shot. We also
                                                wanted it to
                                                have
                                                a warm and casual conversational feel with the subjects being
                                                interviewed. </p>
                                            <p>The subject of our interview also wears glasses. The way I worked around
                                                this is
                                                placing
                                                a reflector at the foot of the light and turning the panel to aim
                                                directly at it.
                                                This
                                                aided the key light which we had set at a higher angle by filling the
                                                face from the
                                                bottom and front, softening up the shadows. Making sure these were taken
                                                care of
                                                in-camera made post production that much easier.</p>

                                        <p>My major role was creating the motion graphics and animations which wasn’t
                                            initially slated
                                            for
                                            me to do. I created our group’s logo and made the animation for it. The
                                            original design was
                                            made
                                            using vector illustrations that translated into After Effects easily. I kept
                                            the animation
                                            simple and to the point but still impactful.</p>
                                        <p>One of the first motion graphics I had in mind when brainstorming was to take
                                            the existing
                                            logos
                                            the brewery had already on their cans. The art used was vintage and had a
                                            hand-drawn look.
                                            To
                                            highlight the style, I created what looked like paper cutouts of the
                                            different layers I
                                            felt were there.</p>
                                        <p>I used Illustrator to do this, since at this point, I didn’t know that you
                                            could import
                                            Photoshop
                                            documents and the layers would be treated the same way. Outside of the
                                            little bit we had
                                            done in
                                            class, this was the first animation that I made in After Effects. I created
                                            a few of these,
                                            one
                                            of which I also took initiative to learn Duik Angela to make. One of the
                                            animations was used
                                            by
                                            a group member to create the lower thirds.</p>
                                        <p>I followed some tutorials to create the map animation and for the inspiration
                                            of the timeline
                                            infographic.I cut the audio from the interview to make it concise and edited
                                            it. I synced
                                            the
                                            animation timing to the key moments in the audio clip. The images echo that
                                            of the branding
                                            already established by the owner. To further bring in the styling, I used a
                                            bright red for
                                            the
                                            pins and the markers on the map, as well as the bold red line of the
                                            timeline that looks
                                            like
                                            the ones on the top of the can.</P>
                                        <p>Finally, I did the credits. I modified a template to feel like the bubbles
                                            and foam of a
                                            golden
                                            beer. As
                                            a
                                            team we didn’t see obvious places that my logo animations could work but
                                            wanted to make sure
                                            they were
                                            used. At the time of the decision, I only had three created and needed a
                                            total of five to
                                            match
                                            the
                                            number
                                            of us that were on the team. Since we each played a part in so many roles,
                                            we opted to not
                                            have
                                            titles.
                                            I
                                            felt that it was important to include thanks to the establishment, the
                                            creator of the logos,
                                            the
                                            school,
                                            and the Algonquin peoples on top of those we had interviewed. Unfortunately,
                                            our main
                                            subject’s
                                            father
                                            had
                                            passed away during the post production of this piece. We included a tribute
                                            to him before
                                            the
                                            credits

                                        <p>I had the role of final editing. The main tasks I had were color grading the
                                            second camera
                                            that
                                            we used
                                            and to keyframe all of the cuts made in the audio. Due to the differences in
                                            cameras, there
                                            was
                                            a
                                            dramatic
                                            difference in the white balance between the two. Since the video was already
                                            cut and
                                            sequenced,
                                            I used
                                            an
                                            adjustment layer to quickly apply the same settings over all of the clips. I
                                            then went back
                                            and
                                            tweaked
                                            the ones that were a little further off. Unfortunately, the room tone we
                                            initially took was
                                            no
                                            longer
                                            with
                                            the project. The main way I got around this was by finding a pause between a
                                            question being
                                            asked and
                                            the
                                            answer that followed. It wasn’t the ideal situation, but at least there was
                                            room tone under
                                            all
                                            of the
                                            cuts and the keyframes done. Finally, I added the music. I identified the
                                            key moments and
                                            made
                                            sure to
                                            place the more emotional break in the music on those parts and blended the
                                            ends of the music
                                            with the
                                            next. We limited our video to have two tracks, one was used for the
                                            interview and the second
                                            was
                                            used
                                            for
                                            the animations and the credits. We wanted to make sure there was a
                                            energizing rock tune but
                                            still
                                            cinematic to carry along the narrative,</p>

                                        <p>There were some challenges with this project that made for good learning
                                            experiences. When
                                            working on a
                                            large project, I like to work as if the timeline is about a quarter less
                                            than what is given.
                                            I’ve
                                            experienced unexpected setbacks or interruptions, and by working with the
                                            decrease in
                                            allotted
                                            time
                                            allowed me to stay on track when that happens. If there is no disruption, it
                                            allows for more
                                            polishing
                                            time. Unfortunately, when working in a group not everyone shares this
                                            method, and it can be
                                            quite
                                            stressful. One way I managed this was my self-guided learning on After
                                            Effects even though I
                                            didn’t have
                                            the footage at the time. I built a template that the timing could be
                                            modified based on the
                                            audio
                                            we got.
                                            I
                                            also worked on other projects that had a similar deadline. The other
                                            challenge was limiting
                                            the
                                            working
                                            hours on this project. It became a passion project as well as wanting to
                                            make something that
                                            would pass
                                            the assignment.</p>

                                        <p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience and has led me to
                                            learning a lot more
                                            about
                                            After
                                            Effects and motion graphics. </p>

                        <p>A group assignment in level four that a next gen technology was to be conceptualized that
                            required two devices to talk to each other and feature a distinct UI interaction and make a
                            promo video for it. I was grouped up with peers that I had been looking forward to working
                            with. We had three weekly meetings with the professor to cover the topics of the pitch, the
                            storyboards and then a rough edit of the final product. We also took advantage of an
                            optional fourth meeting to get feedback on the final draft and improvements before the
                            turn-in.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2 h5">Initial Designs</p>

                        <p>We brainstormed a lot of different ideas, trying to keep focus on the problem and not the
                            solution. It was a challenge since it is a new skill and is often taught to think of ways to
                            fix an issue in childhood without exploring in depth what the real problem could actually
                            be. A portable allergy testing device is what was agreed on. There were two ideas that were
                            sketched out. Sadly, the parts for the mock product that was visually appealing were not
                            available in time. It was the one due to be constructed out of a pipette controller and a
                            pipette or straw. A third design needed to be pivoted to, one of which the base could be
                            delivered on time. We went with a foldable meat thermometer. It had a similar method of use
                            to the pipette and would be easily adapted into our vision.</p>

                            I was in charge of the UX storyboards. This project didn’t require the storyboards related
                            to specific shots but to focus on the interactions between the user and the UI. I kept to
                            the story we also wanted to tell in the video and what was used as the treatment. I used
                            some stock images to draw over in order to speed up the process.

                                I took on the tasks of the scenes with the device and creating the infographics. To
                                attempt
                                to make the tracking on the device easier and because at the time of filming the logo
                                wasn’t
                                finalized, I created a blue and green screen sticker with tracking dots to put on our
                                mockup
                                device. I created the shapes in Adobe Illustrator and exported it as an SVG format to
                                use in
                                Cricut Design Space. Unfortunately I was out of ink, so my initial plan of creating a
                                single
                                sticker was out. I was able to still create what I had envisioned by using green and
                                blue
                                vinyl sticker paper. To minimize interference through reflection while tracking, I used
                                a
                                clear matte nail polish to take away the shine. In the end I didn’t utilize the blue and
                                green for keying but the color contrast and the tracking dots were pivotal in being able
                                to
                                track and fine tune in Mocha AE.

                            The tracking was the most difficult part of this project. Though steps to track easier were
                            taken, the excitement while filming overshadowed the attention to how difficult the shots
                            would be to actually track. A few of the shots the movement was very quick or there was
                            occlusion and the tracking tools within After Effects struggled with them. Between
                            determination and not having the ability to reshoot, I persevered. I watched tutorials
                            around the use of Mocha AE and focused on Adjust Track and Manual Track. Through that I also
                            learned how to stabilize shots without using Warp Stabilizer. I applied it to some shots to
                            help with some of the jitter but keep the hand held look that we were going for. Other than
                            learning more about tracking with Mocha, I also learned some valuable knowledge on what to
                            look out for while on set if tracking is going to be needed.

                            The information that I picked for the infographics I wanted to be relatable and to show the
                            impact that food allergies have on those around us through the number of people affected. To
                            create the animations, I looked up some tutorials and modified the process to suit the
                            information that was being displayed. One of the tricker ones was the list of allergens
                            tested. The timing of the radial wipe start and end to the same points on the trim paths
                            with the offset took a little fiddling around. I am happy with how it turned out.

                            I am overall satisfied with this project. There are a few things I would do differently
                            moving forward. The changes mainly revolve around shooting day. Although the camera work was
                            well done, I think using a tripod more or
                            renting something like a Gimbal would increase the quality. In post, the framing was
                            adjusted to address a few of the shots that had the young actor looking up at the cameraman
                            for cues. Lastly, not reviewing and directing the shots in a way that kept the difficulty of
                            tracking in mind, as that was a major part in out assignment.

                    <p>This was part one of a two part group final for Video Foundations. We were in pairs and tasked
                        with a creative video and an instructional one that were one and a half minutes to three minutes
                        long. We went through the entire process from a pitch meeting, pre production, production and
                        finally post production. My partner and I came up with the idea of a John Hughs style montage
                        that gives the feeling of getting ready in the 80’s paired with a sharp contrast of being in the
                        2020’s.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Pre-Production</p>
                    <p>After we came up with our idea we started drafting up the documents needed to pitch to our
                        professor. I created the production schedule, equipment list, the budget sheet as if we had to
                        rent equipment from a shop, and the shot list. My partner made the storyboards and soundscape.
                        With our pitch approved, I went to the thrift store to try and find some items to sell the 80’s.
                        I was able to score an intercom, the alarm clock that everyone had and a sweater that oozed the
                        aesthetic we were going for. With our plan in place we moved onto production.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Production</p>
                    <p>We started out filming the ending sequence first. The reason is my partner was the actor, and we
                        wanted him to look older and like the rat-race has a weight on him. For that he grew out his
                        facial hair as much as time would allow and would later shave to play the role on the rest of
                        the film. This added some pressure to make sure the shots worked and to get enough footage
                        initially because the schedule wouldn’t allow time for the growth to happen followed by a
                        re-shoot..</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Post Production</p>
                    <p>I was in charge of editing the footage while my partner was creating the foley and using music he
                        created. This was the first time I had the lead in the editing. I had only done the rough cuts
                        before. One scene I am particularly proud of is when the door is shut to give the impression of
                        getting changed. That transition was envisioned the day of the shoot. The camera had gotten
                        moved between shots. I used the rulers in Premiere Pro to line up the edges of the window, color
                        grading and using a dissolve fade between cuts to make it look like it was one shot.</p>

                        class="img-fluid">
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Challenges</p>
                    <p>Another challenge was not using licensed music, we really wanted to use “Don’t You (Forget About
                        Me)” by Simple Minds and The Police. To meet the requirements of the assignment we used
                        copyright free music, however if I were to make a final version of this piece it would include
                        that licensed track as I feel it sells the nostalgic setting that I had envisioned.
                    </p>
                    <p> Lastly, as the character was scanning through the radio it was planned to have “doom and gloom”
                        clips of broadcasters saying things along the lines of “housing prices continue to rise” and
                        “the pandemic doesn’t have an end in sight”. However this did not make it into the final
                        deliverables. </p>
                    <p>In combination with the licensed music, I feel that the radio clips would have served to better
                        represent the contrast of the carefree nostalgic mood with the unwelcome introduction of
                        bleakness and modern reality. I believe these final touches with minor edit changes would have
                        made the video much
                        stronger. I wish that I had advocated for their inclusion more but at least moving forward I
                        recognize the value of not compromising on my creative vision and I intend to revisit this
                        project to bring it up to the level I can be creatively satisfied with. </p>

                    <p>This brand and line of products are the result of two different assignments. The focus on
                        one assignment
                        was precise and concise writing featuring products or services that didn't exist. I used my
                        skills in
                        Photoshop and Illustrator to stylize the brochure for a novel cosmetic company. I used this
                        project as
                        inspiration for my Shopify assignment that I had in Content Management Systems. I made two
                        additional
                        products, a lip gloss and a toothpaste. I wanted to have an elegant but a dark look. I took
                        inspiration
                        for the logo and color pallet from old wine, perfume and potion labels. The content is
                        inspired
                        by
                        historical horror movies. Filled with puns, the text adds a fun and humorous side without
                        taking
                        away

                                The

                                helped shape the logo design are the words “luxury” and “premium”. I used rich
                                colors
                                like red,

                                and
                                gold to sell the idea that this was a product that those of high class would use.

                                is a color

                                is
                                often associated with night and I used it as the foundation to apply the other

                                compliments the darkness that comes from the black. The gold adds a contrasting
                                highlight as well as
                                to
                                communicate the idea of it being that luxury item. The shape with the die cut
                                corners
                                was directly
                                inspired by the labels. It also gives the logo a bold shape that is neither feminine
                                or
                                masculine.
                                The
                                bats were initially hand drawn and were created to push the narrative of the
                                “creature
                                of the night”
                                and
                                add an element of elegance with the fine detail. The drawings were then translated
                                into
                                vectors to
                                make
                                sure that all of the symmetry lined up. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Copy</p>
                    <p>To create the copy for the brochure, I drew inspiration from a cast of classic horror story
                        and
                        film
                        characters, infusing the text with a blend of puns and satire. The catalyst for this
                        creative
                        process
                        was
                        the enigmatic aristocrat Dorian Gray, as imagined by both Oscar Wilde and Alan Moore. Mr.
                        Gray's
                        review,
                        'I can't see myself without it,' sets the tone for the brochure's whimsical yet eerie
                        atmosphere. In
                        both
                        Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' and Moore's portrayal, Dorian hides away his portrait,
                        a
                        private
                        reflection of his moral degradation, concealed from prying eyes within his home.</p>
                    <p>Then there are the doctor recommendations. Dr. Victor Frankenstein is my favorite of the
                        recommendations.
                        He goes to say “Each ingredient has been patiently and expertly collected and combined in a
                        way
                        that brings new life to the beauty and skin care industry.” This highlights the base of the
                        story of
                        Frankenstein by Mary Shelly in which Dr. Frankenstein creates a new life from collected body
                        parts. I
                        had
                        a lot of fun trying to find all of the ways I could play with words.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Products</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p class="col-sm-6">The initial product is the moonscreen called Moon Scream and the two
                            products that were
                            created
                            for my
                            Shopify assignment are a line of lip glosses based on poisonous flowers, Good Night Kiss,
                            and
                            fang
                            paste,
                            Pearly Bites. I continued to use the same base logo shape as the Moon Scream but on the
                            corners
                            the
                            images
                            were changed to relate to the new products. The colors that were used are black and gold
                            with
                            the main

                        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Become A Man In Just 7 Days Book Cover
                        <p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Summary</p>
                    <p>This started out as an exercise for Digital Graphics. The prompt was to simply take one image,
                        cut out a figure and place it on another background. Through experience and other tutorials I
                        knew that the way that was being shown wasn’t the ideal way to achieve the same effect but allow
                        much more flexibility.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">The Start</p>
                    <p>The method that was taught is using the quick select to select the subject, copy then paste the
                        selection on another document. I used the Place tool to add the full image of Rocky and an image
                        of tiles into the document. I used the quick select tool to get most of the selection done
                        around Rocky, then I used the “Select and Mask” function to refine the selection with focus on
                        the areas with a lot of texture/edges like the hair. I then used it to mask the image instead of
                        removing the background as it was shown in class. By using the mask I am able to preserve the
                        original image in-case I need to make any adjustments to the selection. I found it best to work
                        as non-destructively as possible when it comes to compositing images. </p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Inspiration</p>
                    <p>Once I added some adjustment layers to the background to make the tile look pink to mimic the
                        setting in which the scene took place, I became inspired to attempt to make something similar to
                        a DVD cover. I attempted to remake a DVD cover with this same film in my high school Graphic
                        Design course. I love satire and puns. I found this to be a perfect place to play with them. The
                        title, the synopsis and the inspiration for the seal of the book all come from the song “I can
                        Make You A Man”. There are quotes from the characters and other details used in the book to
                        bring it all together.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">How</p>
                    <p>I couldn’t find an image of Dr. Frank ‘n’ Furter that wasn’t over used or I felt like would work
                        as the author portrait. I used a combination of Snipping Tool and a digital version of the movie
                        I own to go frame by frame to capture the image I did. It is the scene in which Dr. Frank ‘n’
                        Furter is introducing his latest experiment, the creation of Rocky. Similar to the way I removed
                        the background from Rocky, I did the same thing to Dr. Frank ‘n’ Furter, paying extra attention
                        to his hair due to the complex texture of his curls and the fact the original image had a light
                        background that would be very noticeable against a darker color. </p>

                    <p>In the lyrics of the song there is a line that states “The Charles Atlas Seal of Approval” and
                        that sparked the inspiration for the gold seal on the book. I created the seal from scratch
                        using a combination of masks, effects, adjustment layers - the works.
                    </p>
                    <p>I found a knack for making product mock ups, and I applied that to this piece. It was originally
                        just a flat image. It is amazing how this comes to life when it looks like an object that can be
                        held and exists in the real world.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Summary</h5>
                    <p>This is the branding that I developed initially in high school, and then through level one and
                        two of the IMD program. If I were to open my own studio this is the branding I would want it
                        under.
                        The faceless cat is something that has stayed with me for nearly 20 years, so if it has lasted
                        that long for me I think that says something. I would like to blend the old with the new.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">The Original</p>

                    <p>This is the original design that I came up with used on a stationary set. The font choice was a
                        very uneducated choice and they don’t match. I do still love the way I used the cat on the
                        letterhead. Outside of that I hadn’t applied the logo in any other way.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3 h5">The Updated</p>
                    <p>I turned my original logo into a brand through a few of my classes in my IMD program. In Digital
                        Graphics, I redesigned my logo and came up with a mini branding guide. In User Experience I, I
                        continued to brand myself through personas, mood boards, and wireframes. In Web Dev II we
                        applied that branding to a web page that was developed as our final. For now I am going to
                        develop and refine this branding until I am going to do more freelance work.

                    <p>My favorite part about this branding is the icon that I made using the initials and the three
                        stars of the logo. I also utilized that icon into a repeating background motif. I also like how
                        there is the space where the word "Studios" fits and if the studio gets large enough for
                        multiple departments, the name of the department can fit there. That is featured on page two of
                        the branding guide.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Summary</p>
                    <p>This is the final project for Web Development III. The focus of the assignment was JavaScript and
                        the use of API calls. I chose to do the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) one. When I was
                        looking around at libraries I found one called TurnJS that inspired pretty much the whole site.
                        TurnJS turns the website content into an interactive book where the pages bend and move like
                        paper. One of the requirements was to have favorites stored in local storage, and I thought it
                        would be neat to have it as a photo album. For the final turn in, I had to pass up on that idea
                        to accomplish the task at hand.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Assets</p>

                    <p>One of the fonts I chose is Exo as the main font. It is clean and easy to read, but gives a
                        sci-fi feel to it. Consolas is the "header" font that has the same feel as Exo but is a little
                        bit blockier. </p>
                    <img src="./assets/images/photos/mywork/apod-today.png" alt="APOD Today Page" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>I made the books and telescope grow on hover for the desktop, and added a bit of a drop shadow
                        that acts like a glow. I have intentions on creating a animation for the window at a minimum.
                        All the assets minus the pictures from the APOD site are going to have a cartoon/hand drawn
                        effect. It will give a hand crafted, cute/whimsical feel to the site overall.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3 h5">JavaScript</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is something that doesn't come to me naturally. When prompted to write something from
                        scratch, I have a tendency to freeze and have difficulty starting. If I am given a foundation of
                        what it needs to be, I can typically modify it to do what I need it to do if it is a simple
                        function. On this project, there were some major hurdles for me to figure out. The biggest one
                        was getting the book to dynamically build based on the number of images in local storage. I
                        sought outside help since the code wasn’t reacting the way that I had expected it too.
                    </p>

                    <p>Between their knowledge of other programming languages and my understanding of HTML/CSS we did
                        get it working, but at a great time expense and after the due date of the project. For the
                        turn-in I opted to turn in one that has a gallery based on a previous assignment for two major
                        factors; it wasn’t working fully and to the parameters of the assignment as well as the fact
                        that it wasn’t entirely my work. When I continue working on it to get it to the point that I
                        want, the book asset will be implemented and credit will be given to the person that helped me.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-3 h5">Changes Moving Forward</p>
                    <p>
                        Other than implementing the book as the favorites, I have a few other changes I would like to
                        make to finish this as a portfolio piece. First off, I would like to divide the site into
                        multiple pages again. When I first developed the project it was four pages, but due to the
                        assignment parameters, it had to have one HTML, one CSS and one JS file. I am quite proud of
                        condensing my JS file and getting that one to work with no errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing that I would like to change is the book buttons on the home page. I will keep the
                        favorites as a book, but the past pictures are going to change into a tablet, since that makes
                        more sense with how the API call works as well as how I designed the page for it. I also want to
                        create some animations, likely through Lotties, to bring the whole thing to life and make it
                        more like an application than a web site based on my knowledge at this point. Lastly, I want to
                        clean my code up, validate my HTML/CSS and add the accessibility that was taught in Web
                        Development II.
