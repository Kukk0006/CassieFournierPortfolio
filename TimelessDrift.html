        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This was part one of a two part group final for Video Foundations. We were in pairs and tasked
          with a creative video and an instructional one that were one and a half minutes to three minutes
          long. We went through the entire process from a pitch meeting, pre production, production and
          finally post production. My partner and I came up with the idea of a John Hughs style montage
          that gives the feeling of getting ready in the 80’s paired with a sharp contrast of being in the
          2020’s.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="my-5">
        <h2>Pre-Production</h2>

        <p>After we came up with our idea we started drafting up the documents needed to pitch to our
          professor. I created the production schedule, equipment list, the budget sheet as if we had to
          rent equipment from a shop, and the shot list. My partner made the storyboards and soundscape.
          With our pitch approved, I went to the thrift store to try and find some items to sell the 80’s.
          I was able to score an intercom, the alarm clock that everyone had and a sweater that oozed the
          aesthetic we were going for. With our plan in place we moved onto production.</p>

      <div class="my-5">
        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>
          We started out filming the ending sequence first. The reason is my partner was the actor, and we
          wanted him to look older and like the rat-race has a weight on him. For that he grew out his
          facial hair as much as time would allow and would later shave to play the role on the rest of
          the film. This added some pressure to make sure the shots worked and to get enough footage
          initially because the schedule wouldn’t allow time for the growth to happen followed by a
          re-shoot.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="my-5">
        <h2>Post Production</h2>

        <p>
          I was in charge of editing the footage while my partner was creating the foley and using music he
          created. This was the first time I had the lead in the editing. I had only done the rough cuts
          before. One scene I am particularly proud of is when the door is shut to give the impression of
          getting changed. That transition was envisioned the day of the shoot. The camera had gotten
          moved between shots. I used the rulers in Premiere Pro to line up the edges of the window, color
          grading and using a dissolve fade between cuts to make it look like it was one shot.
        </p>

      </div>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Another challenge was not using licensed music, we really wanted to use “Don’t You (Forget About
        Me)” by Simple Minds and The Police. To meet the requirements of the assignment we used
        copyright free music, however if I were to make a final version of this piece it would include
        that licensed track as I feel it sells the nostalgic setting that I had envisioned.
      </p>
      <p> Lastly, as the character was scanning through the radio it was planned to have “doom and gloom”
        clips of broadcasters saying things along the lines of “housing prices continue to rise” and
        “the pandemic doesn’t have an end in sight”. However this did not make it into the final
        deliverables. </p>
      <p>In combination with the licensed music, I feel that the radio clips would have served to better
        represent the contrast of the carefree nostalgic mood with the unwelcome introduction of
        bleakness and modern reality. I believe these final touches with minor edit changes would have
        made the video much
        ber. I wish that I had advocated for their inclusion more but at least moving forward I
        recognize the value of not compromising on my creative vision and I intend to revisit this
        project to bring it up to the level I can be creatively satisfied with.
