      <p>For our level four group assignment, we conceptualized a next-gen technology requiring two devices to
        communicate with a distinct UI interaction and created a promo video. I was excited to work with my chosen peers
        and met with our professor weekly to discuss our pitch, storyboards, and rough edit. We also used an optional
        fourth meeting for final draft feedback before submission.
      </p>
      <p>
        We brainstormed ideas, focusing on the problem rather than solutions, and decided on a portable allergy testing
        device. Despite initial design challenges due to unavailable parts, we pivoted to a foldable meat thermometer,
        which matched our vision. I was responsible for the UX storyboards, focusing on user interactions with the UI,
        and used stock images to speed up the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the video, I handled scenes with the device and infographics. To facilitate easier tracking in After
        Effects, I created a blue and green screen sticker with tracking dots for our mockup device using Adobe
        Illustrator and Cricut Design Space. Despite some difficulties, I managed to track and fine-tune in Mocha AE by
        learning and applying advanced tracking techniques, such as Adjust Track and Manual Track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating the infographics, I aimed to highlight the impact of food allergies. I learned and adapted animation
        techniques to suit our information, particularly for the list of allergens tested. The timing and execution of
        the radial wipe and trim paths required careful adjustment, but I was pleased with the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on the project, I would improve the shooting process by using a tripod or renting a gimbal for
        smoother shots. In post-production, adjusting framing helped address minor issues, but the main lesson was to
        consider tracking challenges during filming. This project reinforced the importance of planning and executing
        creative ideas with technical precision.</p>
