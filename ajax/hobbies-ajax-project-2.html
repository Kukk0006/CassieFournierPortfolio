      <p>Original character designs for the 2023 Comic Con and Halloween. </p>
      <p>The Death Dragon costume was a significant endeavor, marking my first experience crafting a large-scale piece
        using EVA foam. This intricate project ignited a passion for foam crafting that I am eager to explore further.
        To create the costume's fabric elements, I self-drafted patterns and utilized upcycled curtain panels,
        demonstrating a commitment to sustainability and cost-efficiency. The back of the coat features hand-gathered
        and stitched fabric, meticulously designed to mimic the appearance of vertebrae, adding a unique and eerie touch
        to the overall look.</p>
      <p>
        The Life Dragon mask and headband were crafted by adapting the Death Dragon pattern to fit the wearer's
        dimensions, resulting in a more personalized and comfortable fit. The wearer selected the vibrant color scheme
        and created the striking red gem featured on the forehead. Using similar crafting techniques, I made intentional
        design choices to infuse the costume with a sense of vitality and movement, contrasting with the darker, more
        ominous Death Dragon. This project highlights my ability to tailor designs to individual preferences while
        maintaining a cohesive theme.

      <p>The Steampunk costume embraces the Victorian aesthetic, blending historical influences with a modern twist. I
        enhanced a thrifted button-up shirt by adding inset lace, reflective of the period's intricate fashion details.
        The skirt features additional hikes to create volume and movement, transforming a simple linen skirt into a
        dynamic piece. The overskirt, originally a curtain panel, was self-drafted with a zero-waste approach,
        showcasing my commitment to eco-friendly practices. A bow tie crafted from the same fabric ties the ensemble
        together, adding a touch of elegance and whimsy. This costume not only demonstrates my sewing and design skills
        but also my ability to repurpose materials creatively.</p>
