      <p>
        This project began as an exercise for Digital Graphics, where the task was to cut out a figure from one image
        and place it onto another background. With prior Photoshop experience, I aimed to push the assignment further by
        practicing advanced techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of the quick select tool, I used masks for non-destructive editing, allowing greater flexibility. I
        added adjustment layers to the background to create a pink tile effect, inspired by the setting of the scene.
        Aiming for a book cover style, I sourced an image of Dr. Frank ‘n’ Furter by capturing frames from a digital
        version of the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Dr. Frank ‘n’ Furter, I meticulously removed the background, paying close attention to the complex texture
        of his curls. Inspired by the lyrics “The Charles Atlas Seal of Approval,” I created a gold seal from scratch
        using masks, effects, and adjustment layers.
      </p>

        I incorporated satire and puns from the song “I Can Make You a Man,” using quotes and details to enhance the
        design. The title, synopsis, and book seal were all derived from the song's lyrics.
      </p>

        This project rekindled my love for Photoshop composites. I take pride in the techniques and final outcome.
        Additionally, I discovered a knack for creating product mockups, transforming a flat image into a lifelike
        object that feels real.</p>
