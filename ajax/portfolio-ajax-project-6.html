      <p>This project was an amalgamation of all the skills learned throughout the program and was to be completed over
        10 weeks alongside our other coursework. We were tasked with creating a WordPress site to serve as a hub for our
        clients, consolidating their various companies under the single brand of Populii Inc. Additionally, we opted to
        rebrand their identity to provide a more modern update.</p>
      <p>We excelled despite not having a professor for the first few weeks. I took the lead, setting up our group on
        Basecamp and preparing us for client meetings. </p>
