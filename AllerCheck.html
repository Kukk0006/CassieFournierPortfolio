        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>A group assignment in level four that a next gen technology was to be conceptualized that
          required two devices to talk to each other and feature a distinct UI interaction and make a
          promo video for it. I was grouped up with peers that I had been looking forward to working
          with. We had three weekly meetings with the professor to cover the topics of the pitch, the
          storyboards and then a rough edit of the final product. We also took advantage of an
          optional fourth meeting to get feedback on the final draft and improvements before the
          turn-in.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="my-5">
        <h2>Initial Designs</h2>

        <p>We brainstormed a lot of different ideas, trying to keep focus on the problem and not the
          solution. It was a challenge since it is a new skill and is often taught to think of ways to
          fix an issue in childhood without exploring in depth what the real problem could actually
          be. A portable allergy testing device is what was agreed on. There were two ideas that were
          sketched out. Sadly, the parts for the mock product that was visually appealing were not
          available in time. It was the one due to be constructed out of a pipette controller and a
          pipette or straw. A third design needed to be pivoted to, one of which the base could be
          delivered on time. We went with a foldable meat thermometer. It had a similar method of use
          to the pipette and would be easily adapted into our vision.</p>

        <h2>UX Storyboard</h2>
        <p>
          I was in charge of the UX storyboards. This project didn’t require the storyboards related
          to specific shots but to focus on the interactions between the user and the UI. I kept to
          the story we also wanted to tell in the video and what was used as the treatment. I used
          some stock images to draw over in order to speed up the process.

        <div class="row mb-3">
          <p class="col-12 col-lg-8">
            I took on the tasks of the scenes with the device and creating the infographics. To
            attempt
            to make the tracking on the device easier and because at the time of filming the logo
            wasn’t
            finalized, I created a blue and green screen sticker with tracking dots to put on our
            mockup
            device. I created the shapes in Adobe Illustrator and exported it as an SVG format to
            use in
            Cricut Design Space. Unfortunately I was out of ink, so my initial plan of creating a
            single
            sticker was out. I was able to still create what I had envisioned by using green and
            blue
            vinyl sticker paper. To minimize interference through reflection while tracking, I used
            a
            clear matte nail polish to take away the shine. In the end I didn’t utilize the blue and
            green for keying but the color contrast and the tracking dots were pivotal in being able
            to
            track and fine tune in Mocha AE.
          </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          The tracking was the most difficult part of this project. Though steps to track easier were
          taken, the excitement while filming overshadowed the attention to how difficult the shots
          would be to actually track. A few of the shots the movement was very quick or there was
          occlusion and the tracking tools within After Effects struggled with them. Between
          determination and not having the ability to reshoot, I persevered. I watched tutorials
          around the use of Mocha AE and focused on Adjust Track and Manual Track. Through that I also
          learned how to stabilize shots without using Warp Stabilizer. I applied it to some shots to
          help with some of the jitter but keep the hand held look that we were going for. Other than
          learning more about tracking with Mocha, I also learned some valuable knowledge on what to
          look out for while on set if tracking is going to be needed.

          The information that I picked for the infographics I wanted to be relatable and to show the
          impact that food allergies have on those around us through the number of people affected. To
          create the animations, I looked up some tutorials and modified the process to suit the
          information that was being displayed. One of the tricker ones was the list of allergens
          tested. The timing of the radial wipe start and end to the same points on the trim paths
          with the offset took a little fiddling around. I am happy with how it turned out.
        </p>
        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>
          I am overall satisfied with this project. There are a few things I would do differently
          moving forward. The changes mainly revolve around shooting day. Although the camera work was
          well done, I think using a tripod more or
          renting something like a Gimbal would increase the quality. In post, the framing was
          adjusted to address a few of the shots that had the young actor looking up at the cameraman
          for cues. Lastly, not reviewing and directing the shots in a way that kept the difficulty of
          tracking in mind, as that was a major part in out assignment.
