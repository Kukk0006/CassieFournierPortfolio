        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The third semester I worked on a group project that was documentary style video. We chose to do it on a
          brewpub and its owner in the Ottawa area called Tooth and Nail. The story is of Matt Tweedy and his
          discovery of wanting to start the business and some insight into the brewing process he is passionate
          about.</p>
        <p>We had six weeks to complete the project among our other classes and their projects. We made it to all
          weekly meetings with the professor and had all the documentation ready for presentation. At times we
          were even ahead of schedule. Such as when is I had some samples of the type of motion graphics and
          infographic ready to show the professor.</p>
        <p>He was so excited by our work in progress that he slotted us for the first to present. He combined the
          two Video Production classes to present together. One of the program coordinators came to watch the
          first four. I am very proud of what we produced together.</p>

          <div class="col-12 col-xl-6">
            <p>My roles in the production of the video span the whole process from the brainstorming to the
              final edit. The on-set roles I performed were setting up and monitoring the main camera used
              in the interview and to help set up the lighting. I also helped capture some of the first set
              of b-roll.</p>
            <p>Two
              highlights I have from this part are nailing the creative treatment with
              the shallow
              depth of field
              and catching the LED panel reflecting in the glasses of our stand-in.
            </p>
            <p>The creative
              treatment we were
              aiming for was a soft background while still having it present in the
              shot. We also
              wanted it to
              have
              a warm and casual conversational feel with the subjects being
              interviewed. </p>
            <p>The subject of our interview also wears glasses. The way I worked around
              this is
              placing
              a reflector at the foot of the light and turning the panel to aim
              directly at it.
              This
              aided the key light which we had set at a higher angle by filling the
              face from the
              bottom and front, softening up the shadows. Making sure these were taken
              care of
              in-camera made post production that much easier.</p>

        <h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
        <p>My major role was creating the motion graphics and animations which wasn’t
          initially slated
          for
          me to do. I created our group’s logo and made the animation for it. The
          original design was
          made
          using vector illustrations that translated into After Effects easily. I kept
          the animation
          simple and to the point but still impactful.</p>
        <p>One of the first motion graphics I had in mind when brainstorming was to take
          the existing
          logos
          the brewery had already on their cans. The art used was vintage and had a
          hand-drawn look.
          To
          highlight the style, I created what looked like paper cutouts of the
          different layers I
          felt were there.</p>
        <p>I used Illustrator to do this, since at this point, I didn’t know that you
          could import
          Photoshop
          documents and the layers would be treated the same way. Outside of the
          little bit we had
          done in
          class, this was the first animation that I made in After Effects. I created
          a few of these,
          one
          of which I also took initiative to learn Duik Angela to make. One of the
          animations was used
          by
          a group member to create the lower thirds.</p>
        <p>I followed some tutorials to create the map animation and for the inspiration
          of the timeline
          infographic.I cut the audio from the interview to make it concise and edited
          it. I synced
          the
          animation timing to the key moments in the audio clip. The images echo that
          of the branding
          already established by the owner. To further bring in the styling, I used a
          bright red for
          the
          pins and the markers on the map, as well as the b red line of the
          timeline that looks
          like
          the ones on the top of the can.</P>
        <p>Finally, I did the credits. I modified a template to feel like the bubbles
          and foam of a
          golden
          beer. As
          a
          team we didn’t see obvious places that my logo animations could work but
          wanted to make sure
          they were
          used. At the time of the decision, I only had three created and needed a
          total of five to
          match
          the
          number
          of us that were on the team. Since we each played a part in so many roles,
          we opted to not
          have
          titles.
          I
          felt that it was important to include thanks to the establishment, the
          creator of the logos,
          the
          school,
          and the Algonquin peoples on top of those we had interviewed. Unfortunately,
          our main
          subject’s
          father
          had
          passed away during the post production of this piece. We included a tribute
          to him before
          the
          credits
          roll
          since he was an important figure in our subject’s life.

          <h2>Editing</h2>
          <p>I had the role of final editing. The main tasks I had were color grading the
            second camera
            that
            we used
            and to keyframe all of the cuts made in the audio. Due to the differences in
            cameras, there
            was
            a
            dramatic
            difference in the white balance between the two. Since the video was already
            cut and
            sequenced,
            I used
            an
            adjustment layer to quickly apply the same settings over all of the clips. I
            then went back
            and
            tweaked
            the ones that were a little further off. Unfortunately, the room tone we
            initially took was
            no
            longer
            with
            the project. The main way I got around this was by finding a pause between a
            question being
            asked and
            the
            answer that followed. It wasn’t the ideal situation, but at least there was
            room tone under
            all
            of the
            cuts and the keyframes done. Finally, I added the music. I identified the
            key moments and
            made
            sure to
            place the more emotional break in the music on those parts and blended the
            ends of the music
            with the
            next. We limited our video to have two tracks, one was used for the
            interview and the second
            was
            used
            for
            the animations and the credits. We wanted to make sure there was a
            energizing rock tune but
            still
            cinematic to carry along the narrative,</p>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>There were some challenges with this project that made for good learning
            experiences. When
            working on a
            large project, I like to work as if the timeline is about a quarter less
            than what is given.
            I’ve
            experienced unexpected setbacks or interruptions, and by working with the
            decrease in
            allotted
            time
            allowed me to stay on track when that happens. If there is no disruption, it
            allows for more
            polishing
            time. Unfortunately, when working in a group not everyone shares this
            method, and it can be
            quite
            stressful. One way I managed this was my self-guided learning on After
            Effects even though I
            didn’t have
            the footage at the time. I built a template that the timing could be
            modified based on the
            audio
            we got.
            I
            also worked on other projects that had a similar deadline. The other
            challenge was limiting
            the
            working
            hours on this project. It became a passion project as well as wanting to
            make something that
            would pass
            the assignment.</p>

          <p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience and has led me to
            learning a lot more
            about
            After
            Effects and motion graphics. </p>
